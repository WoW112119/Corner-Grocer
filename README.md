# Corner Grocer Item Tracking System

### Project Summary 
The Corner Grocer project was developed for a local grocery store. They need to analyze daily purchases so that they can organize their produce section in a way that best serves their customers. A text-based input file was provided containing a list of sold items. We needed to  transform that list into a program that provides clear business insight. To solve this, I built a C++ application to categorize item names and track their frequencies. The program provides the grocer with three key functions: searching for the specific count of a single item, printing a complete list of all items sold with their numerical totals, and generating a visual histogram. By automating this process and ensuring the data is backed up to a `frequency.dat` file upon execution, the tool provides a reliable, persistent method for the grocer to monitor inventory trends.

### Reflections and Technical Analysis
In this project, I believe that I particularly excelled at implementing the principles of OOP (obect oriented programming) and a clean user interface that handles data input seamlessly. To enhance the code in the future, I would implement more robust exception handling to ensure the program remains secure if the input file is missing or contains malformed data. The most challenging aspect was formatting the visual histogram to maintain alignment regardless of the item's name length; I overcame this by utilizing the `iomanip` library and nested loop logic. The skill of writing clean, best-practice OOP style code will make a dramatic impact in future projects and professional work. By following a "write once, read many" approach with clear variable naming and structured documentation, I ensured this program is both maintainable and easily adaptable for future features like multi-day data aggregation.
